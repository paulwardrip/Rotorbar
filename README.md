# Rotorbar
https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/rotorbar

A bar to help with with your rotation for tanks and DPS and a quick glance for healers to read across cooldowns for available spells.
The rotation feature shows a row of icons representing available actions with the highest priority actions starting on the left. It is aware of various procs, buffs, debuffs, health, power levels and other situational data to give you the best possible suggestions to guide you towards a smooth rotation. The rotation is setup to work with every talent choice available, you can use the abilities that you want.
For users that don't want the hints in combat, the suggestions or entire bar can be hidden while the analysis continues in the background. A detailed combat log will show you what you cast vs. what the engine thought you should be casting and why. The log also shows you all damage you dealt so you can see how various things were interacting during your rotation.
Healers don't have a rotation, but they need to be able to quickly determine which abilities are available to make the split-second decision of what heal to cast, all cooldowns are displayed in a logical order that can be parsed in a glance, in contrast to your various actionbars which are setup for ease of access for your fingers (and that's if your healing cooldowns are even bound to visible actionbars, thinking of you vuhdo / healbot users).
The addon also provides integration for abilities provided by your neck, rings and trinkets... they're easy to forget to use, take advantage of your special gear.

The display is separated into 4 groupings of icons:

* Rotation: suggests spells to cast, can be hidden to allow you to master your rotation without help. 
* Debuffs: the number of targets in combat that do not have your debuffs, very helpful for users that need to tab target various DoTs
* Incoming Damage Types: What type of damage was last taken (steady) / is incoming (flashing). Icon 1 is current target, icon 2 is all other mobs in combat that are targeting you. These icons are displayed for tanks, but available for all specs.
* Cooldowns: spells that are on cooldown (for healers this is the main function and the icons are always visible)

Work is still in progress on fleshing out all the features, and the specs supported are a work in progress. 
The following classes are currently implemented:

* Death Knight: All: 100%
* Priest: All: 100%
* Warlock: All: 100%
* Druid: Feral, Balance: 100% -- Restoration, Guardian: ~50%

Working on additional specs, one at a time.
